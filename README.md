# 🐢 TortoiseLang – Slower is Better

A **sarcastic programming language** that throws errors if you type too fast.  
Complete with a screaming ASCII turtle, fake poetic compiler, and sassy IDE.  
Why rush, when your code can feel... meaningful?

## 🚫 The Problem (that doesn't exist)

Most programming languages focus on speed, efficiency, and productivity,  
leading to stressful coding habits and unrealistic expectations on typing speed.

---

## ✅ The Solution (that nobody asked for)

**TortoiseLang** introduces a language that enforces slow typing.  
Typing too fast results in errors and angry turtle ASCII feedback.  
It promotes *"patience-oriented programming"* with haikus, delays, and sarcastic praise.

---

## 🔧 Technologies / Components Used

### Software:
- Python (for interpreter)
- Tkinter
- PyQt5
- Streamlit *(optional for web showcase)*

### Libraries:
- curses / windows-curses
- keyboard
- time
- fpdf
- rich
- os, sys, re, argparse *(optional)*
- VS Code + Extensions

---

## ⚙️ Installation

```bash
pip install windows-curses keyboard time fpdf rich pyqt5
````

> For Linux/Mac: use `curses` instead of `windows-curses`.

---

## ▶️ How to Run

```bash
python tortoise_lang.py
```
